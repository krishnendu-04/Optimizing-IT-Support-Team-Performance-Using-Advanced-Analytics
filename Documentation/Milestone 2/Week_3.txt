WEEK 3

We learnt about the relevance of live data import,ETL and documentation. Setup our GitHub Repo.

LIVE DATA IMPORT :
  - is relevant and important since the companies/businesses need to analyse the consequences of their business ideas / decisions.
  - We can't get live data of a company without an organizational access. So we'll have to use CRM services to 
    * synthesize or 
    * use dummy data 
  and create an API end point.

ETL Pipeline :
  - Pipeline : flow of work
  - ETL : Extract,transform and load
